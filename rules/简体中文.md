# Welcome to themirrazzgg!
We hope you enjoy your stay in our lovely Discord server! Please read these rules thoroughly - as failure to obey them can result in being muted, or kicked or banned from our server.

## 1. No Discrimination
We do not condone or support racism, sexism, ageism, ableism, transphobia, homophobia, or any other kind of discrimination. We do not allow hate speech towards groups, and we do *not* allow racial slurs in this Discord server. We want to make this a safe space for everyone.

## 2. No Threats or Harrasment
We do not tolerate threatening or harrassing other server members. This behavior includes hate speech, raiding, unsolicited DM spam, doxxing, hacking, and other similar things.

## 3. Nudity and Sexual Content
We allow some types of suggestive content, and also allow non-sexual nudity. We don't allow sexually explicit content or nudity intended to arouse (pornography) on this Discord server. If something you share has non-sexual nudity, please spoiler tag it. In addition, if you send child pornography, we will permanently ban you from the server and report you to Discord. We do not condone or support child abuse in any way, shape, or form.

## 4. Bloody and Gory Content
If you share content with blood and gore, or that contains graphic depictions of violence, please censor it using the "spoiler" feature. Please also add `tw: blood`, `tw: gore`, or something smiliar before the content. We want to make sure everyone feels comfortable and won't click on something they don't want to see.

## 5. Self-Harm Policy
We do not allow content that condones or encourages self-harm or eating disorders, or that provides information on how to commit self-harm or eating disorders. Please be careful when discussing self-harm or eating disorders - in addition, you might want to spoiler messages that talk about these topics. We do allow depictions of self-harm, but they must be spoilered and have `tw: self-harm` before them.

## 6. No Illegal Content
We do not allow attachments or links that provide access to illegally obtain or purchase movies, TV shows, books, music, games, firearms/weapons, drugs, or anything copyright. We *do* allow use of copyrighted content when used in another project. For example, a crazy error using a copyrighted BGM, fansubs for a foreign TV show, or a cover of a song are allowed. If you choose to make fansubs of movies or TV shows, we recommended sharing the majority of it through subtitle files, and sharing 1-2 episodes or the movie trailer as small clips.

## 7. No Malware and Scam Links
We do not allow programs that decieve users, destroy users' property, steal information, or do other malicious things. We do not allow links that try to trick users into downloading these In addition, we do not allow scams of any kind, including ones that claim to give away free Nitro, Robux, etc. Some **non-harmful** viruses may be mentioned and shared, however **still be cautious!** In addition, trojan horses are never allowed, as there is too much of a chance of an unsuspecting user clicking on it.

## 8. No Spamming
Please do not spam messages in our server. This includings excessive pinging, especially of the `@everyone` and `@here`. We are more lax with message spam inside of the #memes channel. However, ping spam inside of the #memes channel is treated the same as it is in any other channel. Please do not raid our server either. Raids are a pain in the ass for everyone, and sometimes can cause actual harm.

## 9. No Alt Accounts
We may allow alt accounts for some reasons, but generally they are not allowed. We do not allow, under any circumstances, the use of alt accounts to evade punishments, such as bans. In addition, if moderators are aware of alts owned by a user; if the user is banned, any alts may also be banned at moderator discretion, even if the alt has never joined the server.

## 10. Server Rule Workarounds
In some cases, users may find loopholes and workarounds to posting inappropriate content. If a user does this, moderators may take action if they believe they need to. In addition, please don't try to find loopholes for sneaking back into the server - it's not going to work.

## 11. Punishments
Depending on how severe your actions are, punishments may be different. For example, ping spamming someone or sending gory content without spoilering it may result in a warning or mute, but things like raiding the server can result in an immediate ban. In addition, our mods communicate with mods of other servers. At mod discretion, users can be banned on joining if they were banned from partner servers.

## 12. English
This Discord server is primarily English, with some possible snippets of other languages. However, we can't moderate every language. Please try to keep chats in other languages limited to the `Kono Sekai` category inside of #international. (Using translation services is allowed) In addition, all of our voice chats are English only. We have 3 voice chats inside of the `Kono Sekai` category: Spanish, French, and Japanese. Please refrain from speaking other languages in voice chats - this is to prevent confusion by users.

## 13. Have Fun!
We hope you enjoy chatting in our server! If you have any questions on what is and isn't allowed, please contact a mod - they will be able to help you. (Please don't spam them though!)
